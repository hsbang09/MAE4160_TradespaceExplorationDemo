COMM
- Redo the comm function to accept any subset of parameters as inputs
- Comm mass and power
- Plot Psat as a function of the number of images per day

GROUND STATIONS
3 OPTIONS
1) 1 FIX GS. CHOOSE LOCATION AS TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL COMM TIME
2) N FIX GS. PLOT NGS AS A FUNCTION OF NUMBER OF IMAGES PER DAY (TOTAL COMM TIME) AND RESPONSE TIME
3) 1 MOBILE GS. RESPONSE TIME = 0. PLOT D_GS AS A NUMBER OF THE IMAGES PER DAY OR RESPONSE TIME. 


TO DO LIST

- Recover Response Time from each satellite to GS1 or GS2. For this:
	OK - stkSetCoverageAsset(conid, antenna_path, fac_sensor_path(m));
	OK - call = ['Cov ' antenna_path ' FOMDefine Definition ResponseTime Compute Average'];
	- call = ['Cov ' path_sat ' Access Compute Export "FOM Value" "C:\Users\Dani\Documents\PhD\coursework\16.851 Satellite engineering\project\models\matlab\results.csv"'];
	- read CSV file
	- compute mean response time for each satellite

- Uncomment the end of sat_system
- Uncomment the end of sat_stk
