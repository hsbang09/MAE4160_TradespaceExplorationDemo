 function [Tm] = MFDisturbanceTorque (D,R)
% Calculates the magnetic field disturbance torque as a function of:
% D the residual dipole of the s/c in A*turn*m^2
% R the orbital altitude in m
% Note : The Earth's magnetic field is estimated as B=2M/R^3 which is true
% for a polar orbit (in the equator it is B=M/R^3)
